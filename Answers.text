Most Difficult part:
The most difficult part was docker. I never worked in docker. It took me some research to understand the 
concept. when I was running the docker containers , I could not link the init.sql file to the database 
container. It took some time to find the command that executes the sql file and restores in the database
container. After that, it did not take long to build the rest of the server.

What would I improve:
If I was given more time, I would definitely improve the User interface.
